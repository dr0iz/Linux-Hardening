- 👋 Hi, I’m @dr0iz aka Steve
- 👀 I’m interested in Linux Security Hardening Optimization, Gadgets and a good Keyboard
- 🌱 I’m currently working on this project https://github.com/dr0iz/Linux-Hardening Securing and Optimizing Linux OS 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on hardening Linux Debian, Ubuntu, Pop_Os and or Mint instead of having to search all over the web, a one stop shop guide for both new and existing users of Linux OS would be ideal :)
- 📫 How to reach me contact me via Twitter aNdr0iz will update with an email soon
